☑️  Testing 
☑️ Static testing   :: tested without code execution  (prevention)
☑️ Dynamic Testing  ::  tested with code execution (find bug n fix ) (white + black box testing)

✅ Functional testing 
  ✔️ unit testing  :: individual modules are tested 
  ✔️ intergration  :: grouped modules are tested 
  ✔️ System testing:: whole system is tested 


✅ Non functional

💡 Testing life cycle 
 ✔️Test plan 
 ✔️case exceution 
 ✔️ report to dev
 ✔️ verify

🎯 software Maintenance
**************************

👉 Software Maintenance is the process of modifying a software product after it has been delivered to the customer.

👉Architectural transformation  :: The system is modified from a centralized to a distributed platform Software re-engineering  

👉Software re-engineering
Changes are made in response to changed requirements but the fundamental software structure is stable

👉Software maintenance 
Changes are made in response to changed requirements but the fundamental software structure is stable

👉Reverse Engineering is processes of extracting knowledge or design information from anything man-made and reproducing it based on extracted information.
 

💡Types of maintenance
 ✅ corrective  :: coding, testing , docuemntation error  (bug fixing)
 ✅ Adaptive    :: enviroment, software error (portng & migration)  
 ✅ Perfective  ::   (enghancememnt & scalability)
 ✅ preventive  :: prevent future prblm (software eng)


💡 Maintenance  process
  ✔️ understand the problem 
  ✔️ generate Maintenance proposal 
  ✔️ Ripple effect 
 
💡 Maintenance  Model
  ✅  Quick fix model  
  ✅  Iterattive enchancement 
  ✅  Reuse ieuented 
  ✅  Boehm's model  

✅ Reverse engineering is about uncovering the secrets behind the product so that you may change it according to your needs. 
✅ Reengineering is the process of amending the product to some new form
✅ When a system is restructured and reorganized to facilitate future changes, it is called as _forward eng

🎯 Configuration Management And Version Control 🎯 
*******************************************************

✅Tasks in SCM process
  ✔️Configuration Identification  :: login_v.1.2.php
  ✔️Baselines  :: ready for releaase
  ✔️Change Control  :: manage changes & making config
  ✔️Configuration Status Accounting :: track each releases
  ✔️Configuration Audits and Reviews :: software satisfy customers 


✅Software Configuration Management Tools
--> Any Change management software should have the following 3 Key features:

✔️Concurrency Management:
When two or more tasks are happening at the same time, it is known as concurrent operation. Concurrency in context to SCM means that the 
same file being edited by multiple persons at the same time.
If concurrency is not managed correctly with SCM tools, then it may create many pressing issues.

✔️Version Control:
SCM uses archiving method or saves every change made to file. With the help of archiving or save feature, 
it is possible to roll back to the previous version in case of issues.

✔️Synchronization:
Users can checkout more than one files or an entire copy of the repository. The user then works on 
the needed file and checks in the changes back to the repository.They can synchronize their local 
copy to stay updated with the changes made by other team members.

🎯 Agile methadology 
**************************

✅Scrum :: braeks into managable project
✅ DSDM :: frequent delivery project ; Collaborative and co-operative among the stake holders
__________ is an iterative and incremental approach that embraces principles of agile development, 
     including continuous user/customer involvement

✅ Crystal :: well defined (not for business )
✅ FDD :: features based 
✅ lean SD :: seeks to change in company
✅ Extreme (XP) :: code n feedback 


✅Roles and responsibilities
  ✔️ product owner : clients
  ✔️ Scrum master : Coordinator responsible for controlling , handling discussions, communications and removing any barrier or problems during the scrum process
  ✔️  Team members : Programmer, a designer, a tester or an architect

✅The Five Scrum Events
